# No GitHub Actions workflow needed!
# 
# Releases are created directly by the releasetoteam.ps1 script
# from the postboy repository using GitHub CLI or API calls.
#
# This keeps the build process simple and avoids:
# - Double builds
# - Permission issues with private repositories  
# - Complex token management
#
# To create a release, simply run: .\releasetoteam.ps1
# from the postboy repository.
